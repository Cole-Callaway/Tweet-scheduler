# Tweet scheduler

This is my tweet scheduler I made because I've noticed that most famous people or people that are active on twitter use tweet schedulers for their account. There are a few different websites that can provide this service but cost a subscription fee. So I thought it would be fun to create one myself.

I use as flask homepage to create the form that takes in the information for the tweet like the message, time and password I created for the app. The time used for the app uses a 24 hour clock style and is on the Mountain Standard Time zone. The date for when the tweet is sent use a YYYY-MM-DD format. I use a google sheet to store the scheduled tweet, time and if the tweet has been sent to the twitter page.
